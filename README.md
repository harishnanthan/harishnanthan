### Hi, I'm Harish Nanthan! 👋

I’m a frontend engineer with 2 years of experience, passionate about building intuitive and engaging user experiences. At [Tekion](https://tekion.com), I specialize in:

- Architecting large-scale web applications
- Optimizing performance
- Turning design ideas into interactive prototypes

I love coming up with fresh ideas and exploring creative ways to solve technical challenges.

#### A bit about me:
- I have a soft spot for Go and C++, but JavaScript holds a special place in my heart.
- Recently, I’ve been diving into backend engineering, focusing on designing, developing, and maintaining well-structured APIs.
- I believe user empathy is key to creating APIs that provide a seamless experience for everyone.
